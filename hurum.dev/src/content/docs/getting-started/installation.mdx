import { Tabs, TabItem } from '@astrojs/starlight/components';

## Install the core package

`@hurum/core` is the framework-agnostic foundation. It has **zero runtime dependencies**.

<Tabs>
  <TabItem label="npm">
    ```sh
    npm install @hurum/core
    ```
  </TabItem>
  <TabItem label="pnpm">
    ```sh
    pnpm add @hurum/core
    ```
  </TabItem>
  <TabItem label="yarn">
    ```sh
    yarn add @hurum/core
    ```
  </TabItem>
</Tabs>

## Add React bindings (optional)

If you are using React, install `@hurum/react` for hooks, Provider, and the `Store.use.*` API.

<Tabs>
  <TabItem label="npm">
    ```sh
    npm install @hurum/react
    ```
  </TabItem>
  <TabItem label="pnpm">
    ```sh
    pnpm add @hurum/react
    ```
  </TabItem>
  <TabItem label="yarn">
    ```sh
    yarn add @hurum/react
    ```
  </TabItem>
</Tabs>

`@hurum/react` only peer-depends on `react` — no other dependencies are pulled in.

## Requirements

| Requirement | Version |
|---|---|
| TypeScript | 5.0+ |
| React (for `@hurum/react`) | 18+ |

Hurum relies on TypeScript features like `const` type parameters and template literal types for full type inference. TypeScript 5.0 or later is required.

`@hurum/core` works in any JavaScript runtime — Node.js, Deno, Bun, browsers, React Native. No framework dependency at all.

## Build formats

Both packages ship as **CJS + ESM dual builds**, so they work with any bundler or runtime without configuration.
